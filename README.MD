# Jobs API Project

This project is a RESTful API designed to manage job listings, with features including authentication, security middleware, and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for job postings. Additionally, it includes a Swagger UI feature for easy API documentation and testing.

## Features

### Authentication
- Users can register for an account.
- Users can log in using their credentials.
- Access to certain endpoints requires authentication.

### Security Middleware
- Implementation of security middleware to enhance API security.
- Features such as rate limiting, request validation, and error handling are handled by middleware.
- Protects against common security vulnerabilities like CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

### Job CRUD Operations
- Create: Users with appropriate permissions can add new job listings.
- Read: Users can retrieve information about existing job listings.
- Update: Users can modify details of existing job listings.
- Delete: Users can remove job listings.

### Swagger UI
- Interactive API documentation and testing interface.
- Easily explore and test API endpoints without additional tools.
